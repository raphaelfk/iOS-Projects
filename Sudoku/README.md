# Sudoku construction process

## The process
I had the goal to make an app whitout following any tutorials, after learning a bit more about the SwiftUI app structure.
At first, I started making the UI and some parts of the app's back-end. I then tried to follow some algorithms for creating a sudoku board with recursion and backtracking, but the boards I was getting had more than one solution, so that didn't fully work out.
Then, I had the idea of implementing a sudoku creator API, to generate the boards, but I also had some difficulties implementing it.
I was running out of time, so I decided to have three pre-estabilished boards for the player to complete and focused on making the app really work with user input.
In the end, it turned out great, but it's still missing some features like generating new boards, fixing the undo button and checking each insertion to immediately detect errors when they are made. I also was not able to make app configurations and styles.
All of these things would be great next steps when further developing the app!
