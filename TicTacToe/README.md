# TicTacToe App

At first, I started a brand new blank Xcode project, but, what I actually was accustomed to, was coding in UIKit. SwiftUI was a brand new discovery for me, and I wanted to dive right in.

I started trying to make an app with the MVC design pattern, which just wasn't working. Then, I started to research more about SwiftUI and how to structure an app with it, and the discoveries I had made it soo much easier to project the app.

After some research, I was still a little lost on how to start the program, so I partially followed a tutorial to get the basic structure of the app, and, then, I started adding some features.

The app turned out great, and I learned a lot about SwiftUI. Knowing what I now know, I will now try to make a Sudoku app because I really like to play the game, and I think that it will be a good challenge for me to evaluate everything that I learned through making this app.

I also need to dive deeper into Swift wrappers, because I feel that I still haven't fully understood some of them. Also want to dive deeper into multiple views, app configurations, and styles, and also try to learn more about the sudoku algorithm.
